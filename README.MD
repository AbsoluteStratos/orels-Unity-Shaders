## [Download here](https://github.com/orels1/orels-Unity-Shaders/releases)

**Do not download the repository itself to get the shaders**

The repository is there mostly for reference, as it contains functionality that requires 3rd party packages to work: BetterShaders and Odin Inspector. If you're curious about the dev process, check out this page on the documentation website 👀

## Installation

[Please follow the steps outlined on the documentation website!](https://shaders.orels.sh)
